> 1. To analyze the progress of a specific stream of research (Alavi & Leidner, 2001; Alavi & Joachimsthaler, 1992; Piccoli & Ives, 2005; Venkatesh et al., 2007);
> 2. To make recommendations for future research (Venkatesh et al., 2007);

> 3. To review the application of one theoretical model in the IS literature (Alavi & Carlson, 1992; Wade & Hulland, 2004);
> 
> 4. To review the application of one methodological approach in the IS literature (Dubé & Paré, 2003);
> 
> 5. To develop a model or framework (Joseph et al., 2007; Melville et al., 2004; Morrison & Bies, 1991; Te'eni, 2001); and
> 
> 6. To answer a specific research question (Cotton & Tuttle, 1986; Dunham, 1977; Griffin et al., 1981; Jasperson et al., 2002; Petty et al., 1984; Shenkar & Zeira, 1987).

> A traditional literature review is a critical review of the literature on a particular topic. The aim of this type of literature review is to identify any background research on your topic and to evaluate the quality and relevance of the literature. You will use your literature review to understand what has already been researched, help develop your research questions and the methodology that you should follow to collect and to identify any areas that your research can explore. You want your research to be unique so you will use a literature review to prevent you duplicating any previous research but also identifying any errors or mistakes that you would want to avoid.
> A literature review is aimed at Masters (MSc students) and research level.

> [!yellow] [What is a structured literature review?](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M87T6ZHW?annotation=TYX69F7S) Page 
> 
> ---
> A structured literature review involves bringing many research studies together to use them as the data to determine findings (known as secondary research). There is no other form of data collection involved such as creating your own surveys and questionnaires (primary research). This approach allows you to look beyond one dataset and synthesise the findings of many studies to answer your clearly formulated research question.
> Sometimes a structured review can be described as being a systematic literature review. A structured review typically does not fulfil all of the criteria for a full systematic review but may take a similar approach by taking a systematic, step by step method to find literature. They tend to follow a set protocol for determining the research studies to be included and every stage is documented.

> A systematic literature review is a specific research methodology to identify, select, evaluate, and synthesise relevant published and unpublished literature to answer a particular research question. The systematic literature review should be transparent and replicable, you should follow a predetermined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria to select studies and help minimise bias. A systematic literature review may be registered, so that others can discover and minimise duplication, and can take several years to complete.
> The systematic literature review is aimed at research (PhD students) level.
