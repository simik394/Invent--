From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

"**You aren't gonna need it**"[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-XPi-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-XPe-2) (**YAGNI**)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-OOC-3) is a principle which arose from [extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming "Extreme programming") (XP) that states a [programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer "Programmer") should not add functionality until deemed necessary.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-XPA-4) Other forms of the phrase include "You aren't going to need it" (YAGTNI) [\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-Ref-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-LSD-6) and "You ain't gonna need it".[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-DPiR-7)

[Ron Jeffries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Jeffries "Ron Jeffries"), a co-founder of XP, explained the philosophy: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you \[will\] need them."[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-RJef-8) [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack "John Carmack") wrote "It is hard for less experienced developers to appreciate how rarely architecting for future requirements / applications turns out net-positive."[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-Carmack-9)

## Context\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Context")\]

YAGNI is a principle behind the XP practice of "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" (DTSTTCPW).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-XPe-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it#cite_note-OOC-3) It is meant to be used in combination with several other practices, such as continuous [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring "Code refactoring"), continuous automated [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing "Unit testing"), and [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration "Continuous integration"). Used without continuous refactoring, it could lead to disorganized code and massive rework, known as [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt "Technical debt").\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\] YAGNI's dependency on supporting practices is part of the original definition of XP.
