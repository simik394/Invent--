Welcome to the TfT Hacker website, your go-to destination for Tools for Thought! As the name suggests, Tools for Thought (TfT) are a unique class of tools, encompassing software and strategies designed to enhance our thinking abilities and creativity.

We have just launched the Canvas Candy Vault for Obsidian.


This is a special tool to learn and enable the highly effective and time-tested Cornell Note-taking method in your Obsidian digital notes and note-taking on paper. One system to rule them all!
