all right so we're actually using obsidian for the first time I just created a vault I downloaded obsidian you don't need to see that crap you can  
0:05  
do that so I'm going to create my first note we're going to walk through actually using obsidian I've never used obsidian this is not sponsored this is  
0:11  
just me curious after watching the no boilerplate video where he's just like obseeding is the greatest and I watch that graph and everything happened and I  
0:18  
thought I want that I want that real bad and so maybe this could be the first time in my life where notes actually  
0:24  
work for me the big push here is that every single time I've ever tried any note-taking program what happens I know  
0:29  
what happens to you it happens to me I start off day one great day two it is not great day three I quit thinking  
0:37  
about it completely I tried this with Trello to keep track of myself I tried this with everything it absolutely sucks  
0:43  
and so I really really want this to work out one problem though alerts will be on  
0:48  
I'll turn them down a little bit so you will be interrupted because this is just gonna be more like a full length investigation stream okay okay and chats  
0:55  
up here they're molding don't look at them okay they're just like why not them weak casted  
1:06  
uh anyways I'm not doing it okay sorry losers  
1:12  
all right get in we're going losing uh again this is not sponsored I didn't even reach out to obsidian obsidian if  
1:18  
you want to sponsor me I will make a small video on this I think I could like it but first let me use it if I don't  
1:24  
like it I don't want your sponsorship I don't want your money I don't want none of you I don't want none of your [ __ ]  
1:29  
but first I gotta find out okay anyways so to create a new note we do a little control n okay here we go we called our  
1:35  
project testes all right so I'm gonna create a new note hello world why not I don't know how this thing works all  
1:40  
right uh let's see Yo and then I'm gonna I wanna also get a Vim plug-in for this you know what I mean I want to get a Vim  
1:47  
plug-in real bad I know let's get there let's get just  
1:54  
hold on let's get there okay we're gonna get there let's just walk through what they do all right obsidian also supports  
1:59  
markdown okay the markup language for adding uh isn't it funny that markdown is a mark up language  
2:06  
isn't it weird it just feels weird  
2:11  
I'm hoping that the vid the the neovim obsidian thing works I don't know I assume it  
2:17  
just works uh people are saying it it's just built in but I don't think that's technically true because there's also  
2:23  
like link jumping and stuff like that I'm hoping that it works more than just that right like I can jump between links  
2:29  
right that's what I really want so I don't know how that works um it's built in okay that seems great  
2:36  
um okay well anyways let's see copy and paste the following text at the top of obsidian notes uh a second brain for you  
2:41  
forever okay sure uh okay okay hold on okay hold on how can I go up down up  
2:47  
down JK Jake help how do I use an editor that's not Vib oh my goodness do I need  
2:53  
to use okay so I really don't want to ever use this so what about Vin you guys are telling me that it's just built in  
3:00  
uh oh do I need to hit Ctrl s how do I save  
3:08  
save why why is this thing not why are these in two different positions  
3:24  
this is like a title oh wild it's like some sort of title  
3:29  
that's not a part of it okay okay enhance UI uh enhance enhance file name yeah title equals file name  
3:36  
oh wait what oh you're right  
3:55  
oh is that right  
4:02  
okay okay okay I see how that works cool cool cool  
4:10  
um all right okay I get that  
4:16  
that is cool okay control comma okay hold on obsidian has been mode we'll get there we'll get there we're just going  
4:22  
one thing through at a time okay space is our fine uh Link's gonna have them later on okay uh good because I like  
4:28  
spaces honestly I like spaces they feel easy to read and if you're just taking more natural notes you'd want spaces  
4:34  
anyway but when I'm doing non those I go Kebab case usually I like Kebab case but then I hate it I don't know ever how to  
4:41  
do anything I swear I I can never be happy all right let's link some notes together all right step one create a  
4:46  
link and this step will create two notes and Link them together double bracket syntax okay hell yeah creta know what  
4:52  
the name three laws of motion okay so I'm just gonna go in here and I assume I I should create it in here three laws of  
5:00  
emotion okay right okay don't do that let's see Laws  
5:06  
of Motion okay we'll copy and paste this just to be like complete about it  
5:11  
uh create another one laws of inertia okay uh let's do this uh laws of inertia  
5:19  
um all right and then what do we do here uh let's see at the end of the sentence  
5:26  
press uh this bracket twice on your keyboard type three okay  
5:37  
hell yeah for those that didn't see that that was pretty sweet how do I enhance I want to make this bigger dude there has  
5:43  
to be a way okay there we go oh yeah finally okay still not big enough I see this is why I like look at this  
5:49  
you can see the drop down this is this is again why I prefer something a little bit different but look at that boom  
5:55  
enhance enhance  
6:01  
I like it I like that so that means I should be able to click here oh yes baby now what  
6:07  
does that look like in Vim see like right now it's not technically supported right people are like it's  
6:13  
just built in I don't I don't think this is currently built in I can't GF I can't go to my girlfriend okay  
6:19  
I don't know uh let's see Prime uh Prime finally like  
6:24  
a liking something yeah into the plugin yeah so this is where you'd need the plug-in right this is where you need the plugin to be able to to take those  
6:30  
differences and do that uh editor Zoom all parts of editor I know yeah let's see uh how did he think it was going to  
6:37  
work that way Prime it's in obsidian wait what the files are in obsidian  
6:47  
the files are in obsidian  
6:59  
they have a great family yeah I'd just rather use Vim though you know what I mean I'd rather use Vim but maybe I'd  
7:04  
rather use this okay so how do I go to settings open graph open switch or open view graph  
7:11  
that's pretty cool I like it I like okay I didn't mean to do that uh  
7:16  
no get it get the hell out of here yes oh my goodness way too much clickies uh insert template open command palette  
7:23  
wait hold on how do I open command palette is it control p got it  
7:29  
uh that means I should be able to do Vim okay how about control T nope that's new  
7:35  
tab settings way down here okay editor always focus and tabs a lot of bossy  
7:41  
like I don't want all the stuff in my face you know what I mean uh vimkey bindings let's do that Vim  
7:48  
mode is for efficient text editing but we can quite counter-intuitive if you are not familiar with him this option might look that uh to verify you know uh  
7:55  
your way around Vim please enter the command uh to quit Vim without saving  
8:02  
um is there a zz that can quit without saving  
8:11  
is there is there a say that you can do with zq  
8:21  
it didn't like it it didn't like it I thought I thought they wouldn't do that because I was like wait a second there  
8:27  
is definitely like uh is it is it capital zq uh quit without checking for changes yeah yeah yeah you you dummy  
8:34  
loser hey guess what hey guess what hey oh hey guess what dummy loser  
8:40  
obsidian you don't even know how to quit film what a bunch of losers requiring me to do this they don't even  
8:47  
know how uh okay uh how about uh quit Bang  
8:55  
uh that's actually the correct answer dummy did you not look at it  
9:01  
is the correct answer quit bang quit doesn't do it right no X saves you dummy  
9:08  
x x is w q my father didn't know I I dude I've been  
9:16  
all about the other stuff maybe no colon don't you get everyone loves the colon okay  
9:24  
all right uh Prime is losing his vimness nah I just don't use zq or ZZ it's just not  
9:32  
for me it's never been for me I don't know why but you know when you've been the thing is is that it's  
9:37  
I have such great muscle memory around a specific thing it's just like I don't really want to do that you know what I  
9:43  
mean ugh anyways all right step two create a link uh to a  
9:49  
non-existent note okay you can create links to notes that don't exist yet for when you want to dive into a topic later in your three laws of motion notes like  
9:56  
Isaac and Newton okay and press the bracket once okay so I should  
10:02  
okay uh backpack backpack uh VAP oh yeah okay oh  
10:08  
no I don't like that jumping but whatever uh because I can't go down can we take off line wrap can you take off  
10:13  
line wrap uh set no set no rap  
10:19  
okay so we can't we can't do that I would really prefer it if I didn't have to do this  
10:25  
um if I there we go and so I should be able to just hit I assume I can just hit bracket  
10:31  
now how does that work in okay so I can't hit bracket now see okay  
10:36  
so this is kind of interesting right uh do I press I then okay so how do I do  
10:43  
that in this mode how do I do it in Vim mode  
11:00  
okay back to vs code now right click I don't want to rake right click  
11:07  
Bodies in Motion uh back to Vim uh go to I did go to insert mode uh two brackets  
11:12  
is a link I know that but it said highlight this so I'm going f i v t uh bad so there we go I've highlighted  
11:18  
Isaac Newton if I go little case I it's not going to do that that's not how you you can't go into insert mode like that  
11:24  
okay it's not gonna let me go there if I do double bracket it ain't doing it instead bracket took me up there I'm not  
11:31  
really sure why bracket took me up there uh that's not taking me with the paragraph movement okay uh need to  
11:37  
select after insert mode that doesn't also makes no sense  
11:44  
wait hold on C opening and closing parentheses how does that make any sense opening  
11:50  
parentheses should jump to the opening of the next paragraph all right anyways  
11:56  
um f-i-v-t that colon  
12:02  
and then I can't I can't do anything with that yeah see I can't even do anything in there okay so I'd have to go  
12:07  
like this I'm just gonna have to go oh my goodness uh hold on someone said  
12:12  
go to settings and go to something about editor line let's see display readable line length  
12:21  
okay uh f i so apparently maybe if I go like this  
12:27  
I mean that works it's not what I wanted to do is there a way to like jump on this go  
12:32  
to definition go to oh GD doesn't work well GD people I really want a GD to  
12:37  
work gf go to girl girlfriend okay so neither GD or that hey thank you for the r dollars  
12:44  
I appreciate that Vim is kind of broken in obsidian yeah hey thank you for more our dollars wait  
12:51  
is that the same our dollars am I am I confused the file doesn't exist yet oh yeah  
12:57  
that's right it doesn't exist it doesn't create it I'm gonna plan on using that yeah oh the link doesn't go anywhere highlight cut  
13:04  
add yeah I know that's weight that's weight this is just that's so much stuff  
13:09  
um I guess I could technically go like this uh hit him with the S take that oopsies  
13:15  
I did the wrong thing uh undo and then just hit him with the paste and throw in one of those right  
13:21  
I mean we can make it work no matter what okay anyways fantastic so that means I'm gonna have to create a  
13:27  
new uh I just hit Ctrl n hey can shift hey control n uh Isaac  
13:35  
Newton new Newton uh go back  
13:41  
so now I should be able to girlfriend right jump to definition girlfriend jump to the girlfriend I literally can't  
13:51  
so that doesn't work either but I can certainly click it damn it uh I know I did I tried it doesn't work with  
13:57  
standard Vim stuff  
14:03  
control e oh okay well I mean that sucks it really shouldn't be controlly it  
14:08  
really shouldn't be controlling how do I go back is there a way to go back um can I go Ctrl o  
14:15  
I mean that works so you're saying control e control e did not I don't even know  
14:21  
where control e went to tell you the truth where's my where's my cursor um control lead  
14:28  
oh control e is like presentation mode okay alt Alt Enter creates an open file  
14:34  
Alt Enter opens up uh try ligma dick okay I could try that that's View mode yeah I know I figured  
14:39  
that uh control Open Bracket  
14:47  
I'm not sure what's happening but it's just getting worse I the more I press it the more I hate it  
14:53  
that turned into like code mode okay uh control enter control enter uh control enter control  
15:02  
enter sucks I don't like that but fine whatever  
15:13  
it needs to be capital F girlfriends no way yeah capital F girlfriend just what  
15:18  
capital F girlfriend should do should also consider line number and column number offsets uh you can see the disappointment in  
15:24  
space I know I really don't like control enter it whenever you see this is why I just  
15:30  
need here that's it uh obsidian neovim I hate when people add in I hate when you  
15:36  
have Vim emulation mode and then you don't just simply have like standard Vim things that are in there like jump to  
15:42  
definition should just work that's like a great way to do it right jump to definition is like that's what you  
15:48  
should use if you can't use jumper definition I totally can buy girlfriend right GF would also be completely  
15:54  
acceptable but beyond that like control enter that just doesn't make any sense  
16:01  
go to see look they use GF I think that's completely acceptable completely acceptable uh usage  
16:07  
all right commands I'm sitting backlinks okay so this seems like the this seems like the play I guess I'm gonna have to  
16:13  
I'm gonna have to get some sort of a neovim compy I wonder if it works with Mason and LSP zero I don't know  
16:18  
um  
16:28  
[Music] I don't know what that equals  
16:38  
but thank you for the incredible sounds and everything look at that that thing is awesome  
16:44  
that's a lot of Bitties ten thousand dollars  
16:54  
oh people we got it dude can we get some Elves in the chat can we get some hugs in the chat right  
17:02  
now for our boy atomic neovim dude that sucks man I am so sorry  
17:10  
dude I am so sorry that's just the worst that's just dude I trust me I can  
17:19  
dude my man we're sorry hugs all around give give the boy a hug  
17:29  
dude F man f M I'm sorry bud  
17:38  
why do I have two space indenting here  
17:55  
I wonder what's gonna break when I pack or sink my guess is everything's gonna break when I pack or sink  
18:02  
um all right so let's do this uh requirements requirements neovim yep we  
18:08  
got that uh this plugin uses vim.fs which is only added in uh eight okay if you want completion and search results  
18:14  
recommended you also need rip grip which we have um we got that one search functionality uh obsidian search obsidian quick switch  
18:21  
commands also requires telescope or one fcfl okay we got that one nice uh  
18:26  
install and configure to let's see configure obsidian let's see you need to call this thing setup which uh with the  
18:32  
desired options okay well let's just let's just grab whatever they have so far this seems pretty nice you know what I  
18:39  
mean uh  
18:47  
I told you something was going to go wrong somehow tree sitter always has  
18:52  
compilation issues I've literally never gone through a tree sitter  
18:57  
that didn't have some one of the parsers failed to uh to get to get  
19:04  
on tree [ __ ] that's why we call it tree [ __ ] we don't call it three shooter for no reason okay boys uh let's  
19:09  
go into here and let's go into after plugin and let's go to  
19:16  
obsidian.alua paste that all in here uh there we go lazy true read buff path to  
19:22  
My Vault if you want to use the tail on  
19:27  
so I need to go path to My Vault here interesting  
19:34  
okay um I guess we can definitely do that um let's see can I use let's see  
19:41  
you need to call Vim expand oh you need to do this I just want to call home do I can I just do that  
19:53  
there we go and then we gotta go uh personal slash  
20:01  
oh okay personal and then it's uh these notes if I'm not mistaken Then star  
20:09  
Stars MD is that what they had yeah star star MD  
20:14  
okay cool this is not packer Packard is what what you copy the config  
20:21  
for lazy oh is this for lazy oh crap ah crap we don't want to do that  
20:28  
you're right we'll keep that there uh in fact we're  
20:33  
gonna go here add that okay cool uh Packer go here add that  
20:46  
I wasn't even reading the thing I thought that was all right good enough for me all right we want to do this uh this thing no we  
20:52  
don't need to do that let's go like this uh personal uh uh these notes there we  
20:58  
go all right see below for a list of options uh let's  
21:05  
see optional if you keep notes in a specific subdirectory log levels daily notes folder dailies  
21:12  
um okay completion if you use neovim copy set false to  
21:17  
otherwise I kind of feel like a trigger completion with this one  
21:24  
let's see where to put new notes created from completion oh interesting  
21:31  
interesting right here which one do we do huh  
21:39  
this is a lot of work just to not use a mouse yeah I don't like using mouses  
21:46  
I'm sorry that I like to be at least mildly thorough note ID function customize how name and  
21:53  
IDs for new notes are created okay uh create uh notes IDs and settle cast and  
21:59  
format Little cast and um  
22:04  
let's see okay we got I like that they went with everything okay templates date format time format beautiful uh  
22:12  
follow URL thunk Vim jobstart open URL wait what game Mario  
22:18  
optional by default when you use obsidian follow link uh let's see on a link to an external URL it'll be ignored  
22:25  
but you can customize the behavior here oh nice okay okay cool okay cool  
22:31  
cool so let's say you said someone who's probably bends over backwards to use JS  
22:36  
everywhere got him we're just using let's see let's say open app and uh foreground optional set  
22:43  
to True uh set to true to force obsidian open to bring the app uh to the foreground I  
22:49  
don't want it to be in foreground I actually want it to be in the background finder uh telescope I should probably just do this  
22:55  
right I feel like I should definitely do one of those  
23:01  
I definitely want to I definitely want that is there anything else I probably need  
23:07  
in here at least for now we'll just say no I just I  
23:14  
we'll try this right I'm not sure if this is going to be  
23:19  
great or not but we can try it I mean technically I use LSP zero so I  
23:24  
don't really know what happens underneath the hood with LSPs or to be real I have no idea how LSP zero Works hey thank you  
23:30  
uh it's using OS X open shouldn't you switch it to xdg well I'm not sure if that's the default or what happens right  
23:37  
this one I'm not sure which I don't really know what's the default here I just figured  
23:42  
I'd run into the air and then once I run into the air then I know that I gotta I gotta I gotta change it right  
23:51  
that's how I figured it uh at least I'm using it uses okay okay just use the mouse no stop it shut up all right this  
23:58  
looks good this is exactly what I want perfect okay I think this is good I  
24:04  
think we got what we want you know what I mean I think we got it I think we got it I think we got it  
24:10  
right so that's how I program yeah I don't know what's uh keep me uh from using uh neovin Moore  
24:16  
I don't know but Lewis what's keeping me from using oh Lua is really simple that's the thing is like Lua is one of  
24:21  
the stupidest most easy languages in the universe right it is it is incredible if you  
24:28  
don't know Lua you do you just don't realize it it it really is it is the dumbest most  
24:36  
simple language ever like make file false nothing like make file  
24:41  
make file at least it's a little Izzy but who the f into yeah well I don't like building complex things with Lua I  
24:47  
agree with you on that but you know you just know Lua by accident  
24:55  
yeah you know what I mean a little is like JS except blue  
25:01  
always blue right uh Lua is most certainly better than vimal absolutely  
25:07  
absolutely I mean using a table to replace all collections yeah why not it just is  
25:14  
it's Lua is darn simple especially if you're just using it for configuration right this is just an object you know  
25:20  
how to use objects this is just a this is just a property on an object that's a function you know  
25:26  
how to do that and that's fine with me right like it can't be that hard you can't really think it's that hard uh to  
25:33  
be frank they have a sync option that lets you to write on my iPad yeah I know anyways whatever I don't want to talk  
25:38  
about this crap all right so we have this thing this is good so so I okay so one thing I I don't really  
25:43  
like this I'm gonna move this though because I don't really want it on the install step  
25:48  
because I need this this thing needs to run every single time right so I don't want it here so we're just  
25:54  
gonna jump here and we're gonna paste it in here you know what I mean so there we go so we're gonna actually put it in the obsidian Lua post uh  
26:01  
installation step and I'm just gonna go like this right to me this seems better  
26:06  
because I don't actually require in uh packer right like I don't require packer in so this is kind of like a one-time  
26:12  
deal right here and then this will be Auto loaded every time I open up Vim so this seems like the move this seems like  
26:18  
the play uh I kind of feel like I should use notester and not current ER but we'll see we'll see how I feel about it  
26:24  
as time goes on you know you know as time goes on maybe I'll love it  
26:30  
do I not have oh there you go there's my keys yeah I know that's why I'm not doing it  
26:39  
obsidian is the perfect candidate to rewrite in dream bird absolutely perfect candidate alerts are not broken anymore  
26:45  
um whoopsies  
26:51  
foreign  
26:59  
hey thank you uh his ZD I don't know why I missed that thank you for the community sub sorry I'm like I'm just so in the zone I'm so effing in the zone  
27:06  
there you go all right Brian how you doing and we're doing good okay so let's try this so we got obsidian setup I think everything  
27:12  
should probably go okay so let's just jump back here let's quit this thing down let's reopen this thing up uh so  
27:20  
now how do I use obsidian from from neovim because this is what I want template support okay fantastic we won't  
27:27  
even think about that using neovim tree [ __ ] nice uh if you're using neovim tree [ __ ] or not even markdown you'll  
27:33  
probably want to do enable additional Vim regex highlighting I will want to enable it I'm not going  
27:38  
to enable it oh I guess you can do it just on markdown my markdown works really good  
27:46  
okay we'll see what happens let's let's try it out uh what's that thing called what  
27:51  
the hell is the thing called that I use it a tree sitter tree [ __ ] right now I have it all as false okay I mean I can  
27:57  
I can try it we can try it we can try it welcome to Costco I love you all right  
28:03  
so now how to use where's the how to use business installing a lot of the ball configuring demo commands Okay  
28:12  
to create a new daily note uh to open eventually creating the daily note for the previous working day open open a  
28:19  
note in the upsetting app okay so how does this work so I do I  
28:25  
just go like this so hold on so that means I don't even have to open it from within  
28:30  
right I don't have to open it from within these notes it just it just knows where my one vault is so I have to have a singular vault is what I'm is what I'm  
28:37  
kind of taking from this uh Okay cool so that means I'm just gonna  
28:42  
go like this I'm gonna go back to personal completely different area I'll hit this open we got Chad stack uh AOC  
28:48  
Zig best of stack Overflow all the good stuff in here right so that means I go obsidian uh  
28:55  
open couldn't find an obsidian vault does that mean I need to go straight to  
29:00  
the I think I might need to go to the exact folder right I think that's what was happening right  
29:06  
is that this is technically not the exact folder right is it because it's actually testes  
29:12  
I think that's why it it needs to be the exact okay cool all right so let's try this again uh  
29:19  
obsidian open welcome to Costco I love you why did it  
29:27  
open a a googly thing like that  
29:34  
why does it open a googly thing like this why am I getting a googly thing  
29:40  
I don't want a googly thing I don't want no googlies  
29:48  
it has to be that XD xdg open am I getting hacked it's trying to doxy you is it  
29:55  
yeah my my assumption is it's because of uh something with this right  
30:01  
um print why uh what am I doing here question mark URL  
30:07  
let's just try that uh and then go back here we'll just quit this again oh my goodness it's easy uh van I should just  
30:13  
get used to Z q and CC all right um  
30:20  
no messages I don't know why it's doing that I actually have no idea why it's doing that but there we go we have that open  
30:27  
so that means now what do I do here how do I open something how do I open up how do I like find  
30:34  
anything to open up how do I fuzzy find okay how about obsidian search uh obsidian uh  
30:41  
search this doesn't seem right  
30:46  
why is that only showing up right there I don't like that but okay this works  
30:52  
but I don't really love that all right  
30:59  
I don't love that maybe Chrome is linked well it didn't problem with your xcg config you think  
31:06  
so I it didn't it didn't call that function though that's the thing is that function wasn't called  
31:14  
the function wasn't called at all so I know we could use telescope but I got  
31:20  
to figure out a way to open up all the files in there uh  
31:25  
let's see just use a data uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a hold on  
31:31  
there's a bunch of search options it looks like a tri obsidian uh quick switch or something okay yeah yeah yeah  
31:36  
there's a bunch of these commands we'll try that one too quick switch okay uh obsidian  
31:43  
see I I wish it would give me first the files that are available right because now okay  
31:49  
um  
31:57  
I don't I don't I actually have no idea how to use that thing whatever okay so we're right right here can I girlfriend Isaac is not in path but I thought  
32:11  
go to reference with this one why why didn't that one work do I go right here and girlfriend on that one girlfriend on  
32:16  
that one can't do it this is just what I want to do  
32:23  
you didn't put your vault in config yeah I did My Vault right there  
32:41  
I think you have to do a VI no that just highlights an area that doesn't do anything  
32:47  
uh try parent folder let's say please uh let's see please just use this very simple install video of MRC Community  
32:54  
plugin what yeah but look at this  
33:02  
look at this thing you just sent me I don't want to do this this is like this feels like suckless  
33:08  
software here's just a patch I don't want to do that  
33:16  
I don't want to patch uh if you're using vimo Why install  
33:21  
obsidian because you need obsidian  
33:28  
um  
33:35  
rip gold machine for taking notes I know for no taking I know this is out okay so maybe I just need to learn this thing  
33:40  
okay we'll figure out the Vim stuff later because you know maybe it's just not worth it uh I'm I can get used to this  
33:48  
whatever let's just move on I just want to understand let's just understand the obsidian stuff  
33:54  
further right I'm fine just understanding the obsidian stuff fuvim  
34:01  
I'm sorry all right Imports notes okay actually link notes I'm sure there's more stuff I haven't created in here navigate between  
34:06  
this yes by pressing Ctrl yep I don't want to do that I don't want to click things I don't  
34:13  
like clicking things just just give me the give me the give me the give me the mean give it to me raw learn more  
34:18  
understanding how your notes are connected becomes increasingly more difficult as your Vault grows learn how to use graph view to deepen insights yes  
34:24  
graphy lets you uh visualize the relationship between your notes to open graph view click open graph graph you in  
34:30  
the ribbon yep yep okay yeah I figured that's how it goes to navigate around uh scroll with  
34:37  
your scroll boss we'll do this move the graph around by dragging it with your mouse cursor you can also hold shift or use your keyboard to speed up movements  
34:42  
okay okay filters okay hold on I can I just get  
34:48  
like instead of just like I don't want to highlighted well hold on before we do that let's just keep going through this thing before we get before we get  
34:54  
distracted let's do this uh I don't think that uh  
35:00  
yeah I don't know I would not expect this like I I wouldn't I would never use this  
35:05  
as like that would never cross my mind  
35:10  
I know it's not a pat well I mean it is a patch I understand it's it's lit but it's it's  
35:16  
literally a patch I have to take this I have to copy this I have to paste this and I have to go use this in my stuff  
35:22  
it's also in vimal I'm gonna have to rewrite it all in Lula I don't want to do any other stuff right  
35:27  
I don't want to do any of that I'm sorry I don't want to do any of that look  
35:34  
you know what I mean all right let's just keep on going I'm not getting distracted by your by nonsense I refuse all right if you're  
35:41  
moving to obsidian from a different note-taking app you may want to import existing notes I'm not okay so I so this  
35:46  
is okay I can skip this entire thing syncing okay uh syncing means you keep your notes up to date across your  
35:52  
devices such as your laptop and phone the easiest way to do this is by using obsidian Sync It's sponsorship I don't  
35:58  
have a sponsorship okay I don't I don't even know I know nothing okay  
36:04  
so we can look at this later on blah blah blah blah I'd rather use GitHub I'm hoping I can use GitHub but it looks  
36:10  
like you they actually want you to use something like Google Drive sync thing is sync thing from Theo  
36:17  
is this a Theo product  
36:24  
is that Theos field are you in obsidian Theo  
36:30  
what I would never have guessed that  
36:36  
I don't believe you this is not field don't even try that with me you know how I can tell the t is NOT capitalized okay  
36:41  
the t is NOT capitalized obsidian part of uh see that you know  
36:47  
you know I maybe you could have okay so now I know we need some plug-ins right  
36:54  
we need plugins right we need plugins uh this page lists the core plugins that come installed with  
37:00  
obsidian core plugins are officially built and supported by obsidian team the core plug-ins yep okay uh some of the  
37:05  
core plugins are disabled by default right there's a bunch of them okay I don't care about audio recorder backlinks what the hell's backlinks  
37:12  
let's see within the backlinks plugin you can see all the backlinks for an active node a battery your bad feelings  
37:17  
there's a note oh sorry hey thank you very much I appreciate that AMR let's go  
37:23  
let's go a backlink for a note is a link from another note to that note in the following example the three laws of  
37:29  
motion node contains a link to the Isaac Newton note the corresponding backlink would  
37:34  
link from Isaac Newton back to the laws of motion back does it though  
37:40  
it doesn't look I mean I currently don't have anything unless if I would say like I let's see if I go I Isaac uh Newton uh  
37:48  
did this thing called the three laws of motion boom so that would be a backlink  
37:53  
right right which means I can go here I can go here  
37:58  
oh you have to be inside of it okay that's kind of annoying that if I go like this F capital T it takes me to the  
38:05  
T and then not not oh that's just a link oh okay so I'm gonna erase that then there  
38:12  
we go no okay calm down I don't want to record any audio command  
38:17  
Palais yeah okay I want command palette obsidian gives you the access to many uh commands in obsidian directly from your  
38:22  
keyboard okay so how do I install plugins  
38:29  
I love you is there like uh  
38:36  
core plugins backlinks are on bookmarks canvas command Palais use command  
38:41  
control shift is it control shift p or is it just control P this is the command palette  
38:48  
okay so that has new to oh okay okay okay isn't the command palette in vs code  
38:53  
command t is in command P fuzzy finding and command T command palette  
39:02  
or am I way off here I think I'm right thank you uh arise now and butt Woopa  
39:09  
thank you very much for the community sub and angry laquito thank you very much  
39:14  
for the tier one sorry I've missed all these in Game Freak let's go I don't know how I missed like honestly I'm just like so in thought  
39:21  
vs what CSP classic Child Protective Services is  
39:29  
what happens when you use vs code uh time to abandon that new the keyboard shortcut yep I know it was actually me  
39:34  
remember that thing that people say I forget there's a someone's someone's law gold gold someone's law where you say  
39:43  
the wrong thing and you get her you get corrected really really really fast  
39:49  
right isn't that what you do you guys won't give me gold the nuts law  
39:55  
yeah right Jeff goldblum's law  
40:02

40:08  
Cunningham she was my first she was my first crush  
40:16  
Mrs Cunningham Austin Powers she was my like first movie star Crush  
40:22

40:28  
if you don't know this miss or no it's Kensington not Cunningham Kensington Kensington Kensington not I thought it  
40:34

40:40  
was way off look at this I don't even know see she was like my first crush who is that is that  
40:46  
I don't even know who that actress is anyways uh Elizabeth Hurley I thought it was Elizabeth Hurley but I was like no I  
40:52

40:57  
oh Cunningham is from Happy Days okay I didn't watch that uh I'm Richie Cunningham and this is my wife Oprah yes  
41:03  
yeah I didn't know that yeah I just did it again look at this look at that look at me go it's Kensington this  
41:10  
is Kensington uh anyways all right let's go back to this whole  
41:16  
obsidian thing so okay so I already have command Pele on daily notes what is daily notes daily notes uh opens a note  
41:22  
based on today's date and it creates uh if it doesn't exist using daily notes creates journals to-do lists or daily  
41:29  
logs okay what happen if I don't I kind of want to have like a what the hell am I doing right now thing  
41:38  
foreign does that make sense  
41:49  
that's what I want oh what the hell am I doing right now uh  
41:54  
attempt later use daily notes for what the f am I doing right okay you do that you use daily notes I let me try daily  
42:00  
notes maybe I need to try daily notes so how do I do a daily note uh how do I use a daily note  
42:06  
all right what's the hockey oh viewing hockey's nice okay I like that so I can go like this I can go uh  
42:12  
command p and go uh daily daily notes where's the where is it  
42:21  
uh the fastest way to see a hockey is to find the command and command palette there is a hotkey listed for that key okay well it's not  
42:27  
to add hotkeys remove a hockey or restore hockey's to defaults go to settings hotkeys is there a hotkey for  
42:33  
opening settings open settings Okay cool so I go that  
42:40  
and then I gotta go SH now I have to use my mouse  
42:47  
blank all this thing what about daily notes see it's nothing so what do people use for daily notes  
42:53  
I kind of want to use Ctrl D but that feels weird control d  
42:58  
but I feel like Ctrl D feels good you know what I mean what do people use  
43:04  
Ctrl d what about yesterday's notes control y  
43:11  
oh you give them the Big D control big big shift d okay Ctrl shift d you really you you give  
43:18  
them the Shifty the Shifty okay control Big D okay I mean hey okay I  
43:25  
mean I I'm gonna just go with my gut here which is Ctrl d wait Ctrl D there we go one command  
43:32  
conflict well [ __ ] uh control shift d  
43:38  
okay got him control Shifty got him what about the previous day previous day's notes what should I do the there Ctrl  
43:45  
shift uh no why  
43:53  
because I kind of feel like I have to keep the shifting thingy going daily notes open today's daily notes  
43:59  
oh wait that would be this one that's the control shift d this one is open next  
44:05  
daily note what is next daily note let's see uh you are always the slowest  
44:11  
Mouse user ever hey yeah CS CSD for today's notes CSD  
44:19  
oh that's Ctrl shift Ctrl shift t  
44:26  
that's already I wish they would tell you what the what is it conflicting with can you just show me what it's conflicting with undo close tab  
44:34  
yeah I mean I can I don't use tabs I would really never want to use tabs honestly if I can avoid using tabs I'm  
44:40  
happy like look at this this is emotionally painful seeing what's happening on here is there a way just to have no tabs  
44:46  
I should fuzzy find and jump only I should never use tabs tabs are just the worst thing in the universe when it  
44:53  
comes to text editing I'm just gonna say no to that I don't need you it makes no sense  
44:58  
like no tabs Boomer dude that's no no no no no boomers are you're you're  
45:03  
incorrect my friend Tabs are for Boomers Tabs are for people who just started using a computer and they didn't realize  
45:10  
that you you shouldn't ever use tabs tabs increase my cortisol by an intense  
45:16  
amount they're worthless all right it is cool that I can click I  
45:23  
I was able to click this and it was able to show me what was going on okay so that means I should be able to go like this uh hit him with the  
45:29  
D that's today all right uh today feels like a good day for the Big D all right  
45:36  
uh there we go well a little save let's go to yesterday oh I kind of want that for yesterday I'm not gonna lie to you  
45:42  
control shift find feels like a good what is these search options path of the  
45:47  
file well can't I use path to the file with control P right should I be able to go Isaac Newton  
45:53  
oh damn that's not that's okay that is one so Ctrl shift f is going to be Isaac  
46:01  
damn okay interesting that's not what I wanted but okay  
46:07  
uh Ctrl shift why isn't that isn't that one didn't I have Ctrl shift  
46:13  
y as one there's no daily notes uh before this one okay so how do I do yesterday's note  
46:18  
what how do I not open it  
46:23  
let's see open let's see open let's see open previous days notes so okay so there is none I can't do that open next  
46:29  
notes Ctrl shift t there is no note after this okay  
46:34  
so is there a way to jump backwards through notes  
46:40  
control L search oh yeah see okay then what the hell is control F then  
46:46  
why do I have control app welcome to Costco hey thank you very much now we're still thanati still the naughty make it  
46:53  
with the correct name interesting okay so I just would make it with the correct name oh okay cool so I  
46:58  
just take this thing and hit him with one of those and but hit him with an eight and go like that right so now I  
47:05  
got uh yesterday's so that means technically since I'm in a in a day that looks like this if I do control F if I  
47:12  
do T I'd go forward one and if I do control f y I go backwards one  
47:18  
all right does that keep does that work at infinitum really  
47:28  
see now I have to go find it in this thing how do I is there a way just to jump backwards is there a control o  
47:33  
equivalent in obsidian do you know what I mean is there a control oh like  
47:39  
does it have Harpoon I know now I kind of want Harpoon right is there like what what is the thing a jump list yeah is  
47:45  
there a jump list  
47:52  
control that doesn't do it okay hold on uh control I you say control I  
47:59  
know that's italicized you you dummy yeah dummy uh control let's see Control  
48:05  
Alt shift left [ __ ] don't  
48:11  
Control Alt shift left Arrow uh control keys would be cool  
48:18  
I mean I I could totally do control keys I can totally do control keys shift 69 okay yeah yeah okay okay I  
48:25  
gotta go pee I gotta go pee I am peeing all right  
48:30  
control shift alt meta super Windows key you need to do all the uh you need to  
48:37  
actually get out of MacBook and get a command key pressed just on a separate computer just to make this thing work okay so that means I should be able to  
48:43  
go up here to settings and go previous uh previous file is there like a  
48:49  
so they don't have a previous they must have like what's okay does anyone actually know that navigate back that's  
48:54  
okay navigate back as Control Alt Arrow no  
49:00  
who does that who came up with these things  
49:07  
no I I can't use control o which is a true  
49:13  
tragedy it's a true tragedy so I'm gonna make it into a non-tragedy Ctrl o there we go so  
49:20  
how do I do that thing where I do this uh quick switcher no quick quick switcher okay so this is what we're  
49:25  
gonna do with this one we're gonna make you oh come on dang it quick switcher  
49:31  
we're gonna make you control p this one command palette should be Ctrl  
49:40  
shift p right  
49:46  
Now navigate back should be Ctrl o navigate forward should be Ctrl I is  
49:52  
that fair or is that not is that it's not a jump list right maybe I should use control care you know  
49:59  
control I talk like italics I mean I get  
50:04  
I'm just not going to use that what kind of [ __ ] is that anyways okay I feel like I'm the Costco I love you there we  
50:11  
go see dude Tabs are just the worst okay the next thing I gotta get rid of these tabs I am I am  
50:18  
I'm actually getting cortisol I'm getting cortisol issues uh Manny munzy  
50:23  
uh uh Muniz Manny Muniz is there a way there must be a setting in here that tells me that I can um  
50:30  
open Link in current tab  
50:36  
I can't use that is there is there a let's see smart list and dance indent tabs indents Advanced Auto is there is  
50:42  
there like an open link in current tab  
50:50  
I kind of like line numbers on it makes me feel good about myself there is a there is a no tab plugin okay so how do  
50:56  
I install plugins like I see that there's core plugins uh no tab  
51:06  
how do you let's see how do you do  
51:11  
Community plugins oh is there a community oh yeah I'm a dumb dumb okay uh let's see turn on community plugins  
51:17  
oh I'm so turned on right now uh okay can we browse uh no tab  
51:25  
default tab CSV open a new tab tab City and tab tab no tabs so this is the one  
51:31  
replaces the current tab when creating a new note yeah oh  
51:40  
how about when following link okay good I like this uh let's see unfortunately there is no way of  
51:46  
changing this behave let's say hold on hold whenever a let's see whenever you create a new taben obsidian a new tab is opened you can get it can get quite  
51:52  
annoying yeah uh yep I agree with all this this plugin  
51:57  
Works around the limitations okay good because I I just hate that okay so install  
52:03  
okay yes yes so when I do a new one  
52:09  
okay I thought there's no did I not install it NM Apple do I need  
52:14  
to go in here and go to like is there new tabs enabled  
52:23  
let's go all right so if I go unentitled for uh uh and uh entitled

here okay rust kanban okay what the hell is Russ kanban well look at that it looks like a kanban board a daily  
59:09  
activity first off what's the first problem well the first problem right here is that the rust  
59:16  
Foundation has explicitly stated you're not allowed to do that okay this guy's waiting to get  
59:22  
sued okay he should have just called it rust JavaScript and then some other company micros

1:01:12  
it's starting to rise now it's getting really risy I like this but still I'm getting risy I love pick okay pick is  
1:01:19

1:01:41  
now I'm hating my life what am I doing why am I looking why do you guys do that don't do that stop it stop reading  
1:01:48

1:01:55  
actually feel it creeping up do you have a pixel 7 it's so good is it good I don't know  
1:02:02  
uh honestly you know I feel personally attacked dude Doom scrolling is the worst it's just  
1:02:11  
let's see uh content creator who doesn't want you to look at content I'm a content creator who does not use content  
1:02:18  
right if you go to my YouTube it's it's pretty much all music because  
1:02:24  
that's the only thing I watched on YouTube is music and I've recently only started watching Aspen gold I don't  
1:02:29  
watch live streams I want to watch live streams I just don't have time and I can't really interact and it's just I can't do it it just hurts it's this is  
1:02:36  
just me getting excited about creating things you know what I mean that's what I that's why I started doing  
1:02:41  
content creation because I just was excited about doing things I know I know it's I know this is kind  
1:02:47  
of weird but I don't watch content I think that's  
1:02:52  
part of the reason why I have my own style is because my own style is just me  
1:02:57  
making my own things that I would like to make right now okay you guys want to know  
1:03:04  
what I'm doing right now that you want to hear the content I am consuming right now are you ready  
1:03:09  
YouTube you won't be able to hear this welcome to Costco I love you that's what  
1:03:16  
I listen to while I program audiobooks  
1:03:21  
it's Dune yeah it's the Dune when the uh the emperor has now uh just captured uh  
1:03:27  
uh what's it called um the the the the Benny Jesuits which is a child I forget her name but yeah  
1:03:37  
so audiobook I'm an audio Booker right I don't know I want to be you know I'm not gonna lie to you  
1:03:44  
I want to be a little bit uh I'd like to be a little bit more quote  
1:03:49  
unquote well read so I you know so I've listened through some historical accounts hey TCP stream  
1:03:54  
thank you very much I acknowledge this and I would like to say thank you why did the developer cross the road why  
1:04:00  
TCP why  
1:04:06  
ever heard of the three body problem yes yes so I I so I listened to it on the on a ride home and then my life was crazy  
1:04:13  
after that because it was uh I was I listened to it on a on a 27 hour road trip to get home after covet happened  
1:04:18  
and we announced lockdowns and so I drove through the night with my family in the car and I listened to the three  
1:04:24  
body problem and then I just had this massive craziness of coming home during all of that and I never restarted it I  
1:04:30  
was actually going to listen to it right after this I really liked the three body problem I really liked  
1:04:37  
I really like the three body problem I'd like to do that again uh code code and audiobooks are two  
1:04:44  
different code code and books are two different tracks in my brain  
1:04:50  
one track in my brain is all about  
1:04:55  
like logical thinking and the other track in my brain is all about like  
1:05:00  
listing or good feels right and so they're just two different they're just two different tracks you know what I mean  
1:05:07  
the dark force three body problem book two is amazing it is okay I can't hear words when I think too hard  
1:05:14  
yeah I can't even do listen to music with lyrics while working really yeah I I guess I've never had that problem huh  
1:05:21  
funny crazy yeah anyways  
1:05:28  
as you can see I'm also reading chat you know what I mean I'm reading chat and it doesn't bother me I can keep  
1:05:33  
whatever is in my head while I'm doing that  
1:05:39  
uh video game music works uh for me while programming yeah that makes sense for me they both live under the same  
1:05:44  
language processing yeah they don't for me for whatever reason it's so good yeah do I do I play games yeah I play games I  
1:05:49  
don't get to play a lot of games I used to play a lot of games that I don't games are like my favorite activity ever  
1:05:55  
to do but I just don't do a lot of them because I I can't I can't believe I just I I have I  
1:06:02  
literally just lost it I have one last thing I want to do uh in this whole obsidian thing  
1:06:07  
which is I want to understand how you create like sub folders and new notes how does that work how  
1:06:14  
does subfoldering and new notes work right  
1:06:23  
Factoria seems awful I don't want to play factorial avoid subfolders interesting okay  
1:06:29  
okay I can buy that is it just because you just you you just used tags okay so how do I do tags right tags if I'm not  
1:06:36  
mistaken or when I use ah is when I use uh a doc thing right up top right and I go tags and then I can go Foo bar right  
1:06:44  
is that is that what tags are I feel like that's tags right  
1:06:49  
tags and links a factory is one of the is a one-way ticket to stress yeah it's not for me did I get that correct  
1:06:56  
tags uh can have sub takes really  
1:07:04  
yeah I I I don't want a philosophical uh debate I don't care honestly I don't use no I'm not gonna do that uh  
1:07:12  
you can just use Tag as well okay cool I I honestly real talk I don't care  
1:07:18  
I don't care like that's like how little I care and so for me this feels really clear I like  
1:07:25  
this it just feels right okay uh and you know and if you don't like it  
1:07:31  
uh off you know uh  
1:07:36  
all right there we go so now how do I look up by tag how do I get a list of files by tag  
1:07:44  
stop being so edging established  
1:07:49  
uh factorial feels like a feels like you program you build fat yeah see I don't want to do that  
1:07:55  
I don't want to do that yeah you guys uh can all F off uh my to my stream absolutely TJ are you gonna be streaming  
1:08:01  
here shortly normal search Okay Foo  
1:08:06  
that doesn't feel right Foo what kind of what what other kind of  
1:08:11  
searches are there okay command palette uh let's see show  
1:08:17  
show tags okay so there's this whole like tagging  
1:08:22  
so I can go to these different taggings oh so I oh so I go Ctrl shift F and I go  
1:08:28  
tag ah and I can do a tag search so I can search for all those and then I can select which articles how do I go back  
1:08:35  
to that menu how do I go back here you know  
1:08:42  
that's how I do it in Vim control W over but I can't do that how do I go  
1:08:49  
data View and plugins data View and plugins okay um can I go up oh crap data view data so  
1:08:57  
dataview is a community plugin uh data view I feel like I've heard of  
1:09:04  
this is this what we're talking about Advanced queries over your Vault for uh the data obsessed data view uh treat  
1:09:09  
Europe City involved as a database which you can query I mean I like that I don't want a JavaScript API do I have to do  
1:09:14  
that pipeline based query language okay oh I saw this I saw this in uh no  
1:09:20  
boilerplate stuff see this is really cool  
1:09:34  
see I don't understand what this language is doing yet okay so this is cool  
1:09:40  
okay so this is you could have like a home base operations right  
1:09:46  
okay so there's like a home base operations I could theoretically there's a file I could create called like uh all  
1:09:51  
your base are belong to us right and then once you do all your base are belong to us I could have some sort of  
1:09:58  
data view in which I squeal I squeal in some tags or squeal in some to-do tasks so every single one of my daily tasks  
1:10:05  
could effectively have some sort of things I need to accomplish and then I  
1:10:11  
can have them time ordered in like kind of some sort of Mega one right is that what is that like something I could do  
1:10:22  
yeah you mean some CSS some tags absolutely absolutely pretty much yes okay so let's install that that because  
1:10:29  
that seems like exactly like this seems exactly like the thing I'd want to do you know what I mean all right get data view in so data view is in so let's do  
1:10:36  
that right now um let's go like this let's whoopsies let's do that right now wait  
1:10:42  
oh funny okay there we go uh so what are we gonna call this let's call this a home  
1:10:48  
base right so home base is where I'm just gonna have the stuff so I guess I'm gonna have to figure this out really quickly data  
1:10:54  
uh data view right so now that I have a data View uh date uh data view uh obsidian so how  
1:11:01  
does this thing work I enabled it I have it enabled uh  
1:11:07  
Treacher yep okay so let's see table time played length rating  
1:11:12  
from game so what is games is that a tab or is that I mean is that is that a tag  
1:11:19  
or is this like a sub folder is there some sort of  
1:11:26  
projects active what the hell is this it's a folder do I have to have folders can I just select from everything  
1:11:35  
foreign examples uh full references for all  
1:11:41  
details okay overview let's see dataview is a live index and  
1:11:47  
query engine for your personal knowledge base you can add metadata to your notes okay let me check out the metadata oh  
1:11:53  
all right uh here we'll do that in a second let's see to list filter sort and group your data dataview keeps your  
1:11:59  
queries always up to date and makes data aggregation a breeze you could track your sleep I don't care but no I don't I don't care about any of that okay uh  
1:12:06  
data is highly generic and high performance I don't care about that um how to use data view data view  
1:12:11  
consists of two building blocks data indexing and data querying okay data indexing dataview operates on metadata  
1:12:17  
in your markdown files it cannot read everything in your Vault but only specific data some of your content like tags and bullet points included in tasks  
1:12:24  
are available Auto magically okay you can add other data through fields at the top of your file per yaml formatted or  
1:12:30  
front matter okay cool or in the middle of your content so this would be a good reason to use those yaml front matter businesses right  
1:12:37  
so there we go so I can do this nice little this nice little beauty right here  
1:12:44  
from author written in okay whatever in terms of indexing metadata or what you can query  
1:12:50  
this just seems way more confusing I don't want to do that this just seems somehow that seems way more confusing I  
1:12:55  
don't I don't want this I don't want that I don't want that in terms of indexing  
1:13:02  
metadata or what you can query they are identical the only difference is then their annotation style uh okay that's  
1:13:07  
fine data querying to access index data with the help of queries there are three different ways you can write a query there's the data view query language  
1:13:14  
which is the one I want uh as an inline statement yep uh but the most complex way is  
1:13:19  
Javascript well I don't want to do JavaScript the dql the the the the  
1:13:26  
do you know why Dairy Queen do you know how Dairy Queen got pregnant  
1:13:42  
Burger King forgot to wrap his Whopper  
1:13:52  
I know you liked it I know you liked it  
1:13:58  
foreign  
1:14:07  
you're right you're right Karen it was more of a Whopper Junior  
1:14:14  
[Music]  
1:14:23  
I'm gonna sue for emotional damage  
1:14:29  
anyways decal uh uh consists of several parts  
1:14:34  
the exact let's see exactly one query type to determine what your query looks like uh none or one from from statement  
1:14:40  
okay none are multiple from other data commands Okay so for example a queer can look like this list okay what the hell  
1:14:46  
does list do uh list  
1:15:02  
list from poems uh list from Foo  
1:15:11  
okay cool cool cool okay what about uh what about I I want  
1:15:17  
to get some old check boxes I want some check boxes you know a table author okay cool oh so we can create a table okay  
1:15:23  
okay I see what's happening I see what's happening okay  
1:15:29  
I see what's happening you use task instead of Lisk okay well let's let's just look for a task  
1:15:36  
task is I want to see tasks okay so how do we do  
1:15:42  
a task uh task there are no tasks okay so I gotta create a task in Foo now is there a way  
1:15:49  
okay so that means I'm gonna go like this I have to jump up here look for Foo and  
1:15:54  
then I have to like open one of these and then now I have to create a task how do I create a task obsidian task  
1:16:05  
Basics installation I need to install  
1:16:11  
right space your task oh damn okay okay so I  
1:16:18  
just go like this um uh wrap my Whopper  
1:16:26  
is that how you spell Whopper is that a Whopper is that a wet ass  
1:16:35  
puss here did I get that right it's a Whopper that's a Whopper uh uh okay  
1:16:41  
thank you oh no somebody's in trouble uh  
1:16:48  
space in the brackets you Dingus oh  
1:16:56  
wrap my Whopper wrap my wrapper  
1:17:02  
all right so that means I should be able to go back and yes so that means if I  
1:17:09  
click this oh ethio couch wait what just happened  
1:17:17  
what just happened all right how do I how do I just how do I just say  
1:17:22  
it's good from here okay so I have to okay so I have to use  
1:17:28  
my mouse is there a way to not use your mouse is there a way to is there a press  
1:17:33  
control e oh control a for presentation mode but is there a way for me to just do it  
1:17:39  
without like with  
1:17:47  
data view in sales what control l oh that's a task well that's  
1:17:53  
cool um  
1:18:00  
let's see yeah I think can uh control M what what is CRT  
1:18:05  
well I can't get to the line right I I can't get to the line because it's a data View  
1:18:11  
right it's a data View so there is no getting to the line  
1:18:17  
and then I ca I don't have a cursor in this mode right  
1:18:23  
then we're all [ __ ] are you using Fleet no but I do like feet um so like  
1:18:29  
like I can't go in there right okay so this just a mouse only operation that's fine that's fine and is there a  
1:18:36  
way that let's see Han from task where uh is there like checked equals false is  
1:18:41  
there like a way to like  
1:18:49  
yeah let's go let's go that's what I wanted that's  
1:18:58  
what I wanted to see right so okay so checked equals false maybe fudged it up a little bit uh  
1:19:06  
all right so go back in here I'm hitting control e so  
1:19:12  
why am I I'm in Vim I'm in Vim why am I doing that  
1:19:17  
all right so that gives me that so you're also saying we're uh completed equals true can I use that okay  
1:19:26  
okay so I can have or completed equals false cool  
1:19:34  
looks like here it looks like I'm doing a little bit of CSS yeah I'm doing a little bit of CSS you know what I mean a little CIA theft  
1:19:41  
now try with a thousand tasks why would I want to try it with a thousand tasks why would I want to spend my time doing  
1:19:46  
that there is vim mode I have the yeah uh d q  
1:19:52  
l s s uh hi Dad I love you okay this is great I'm gonna use this uh check out  
1:19:57  
the Vim guide so you can use Vim style bindings to move around I I I I have them on right now you can see  
1:20:05  
and it has a lot of stuff it has VAP like long as you can VAP and long as like honestly long as you can dab  
1:20:11  
dapping is big for me okay if you can't daboo  
1:20:17  
get out you know what I mean you know what I mean no no that's not  
1:20:22  
how it works like look at my cursor look at where my cursor is like look at I'll press the arrows to make it obvious what  
1:20:28  
I'm doing when I press up it changes the data view into the underlying quill  
1:20:35  
if I press down it goes back to the present the  
1:20:41  
presentation View can it sex uh sex they can't  
1:20:47  
it doesn't even know this thing can sex this thing can sex with a bang okay  
1:20:57  
anyways because you are in editing mode with live preview exactly but the thing is is that there is no other thing I  
1:21:03  
tried this a while back and it got really slow with a large number of files that's fine that's the thing is uh no sex classic Arch user experience  
1:21:10  
controlling I know but okay guys you keep you're missing the point when I go into control e you lose your cursor I  
1:21:17  
can't I can oh I had to tab to the correct location then maybe I press enter no enter didn't do it space looks  
1:21:24  
like space does it data view is gone you can't uncheck it once you check it because it's gone  
1:21:30  
then I have to control e and I have to go back in here and delete that and do that so I'm gonna have to have like you  
1:21:36  
know I'm gonna have to Yap that and then I'm gonna have to go down then I'm gonna have to paste it and then this is where I can have where uh where uh completed  
1:21:44  
equals true right and then you can have right here with uh oh my goodness why am I using that dude I'm not used to this  
1:21:50  
thing working with that uh where completed equals false  
1:21:58  
nice so that means if I'm in presentation view I should be able to tab space it tab  
1:22:05  
and now it's right there look at that cool  
1:22:11  
no sex is also uh every Helix user if this is true  
1:22:21

1:22:27

1:22:32

1:22:45

1:22:51  
different states okay yeah this sometimes they're across the border in Canada totally normal okay  
1:22:58  
so back into obsidian so is Obsidian uh better than Joplin I wouldn't even know more more like Laura Hill  
1:23:05

1:23:17
