## Contextual Comments(the Original ^^: 100% effective, and super fast)

[](https://github.com/1C0D/Obsidian-Contextual-Comments#contextual-commentsthe-original--100-effective-and-super-fast)

(Adviced shortcuts ctrl : for Line(s) comment, shit alt a for Block comment)

-   Improved handling of normal comments `%%...%%`
    
-   in code blocks (language related):
    
    -   **respect indentation**
    -   selection multiline → starts and ends at cursor position
    -   if no selection → whole line at cursor position
    -   the block comment works on selections around `/* ... */` or `<!-- ... -->`
-   Two commands to trim end lines:
    
    -   one for the whole document,
    -   one in code blocks only (the most useful).

comments in dataview js supported.
