## Remember File State

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin remembers the editor state of files as you switch between them. It restores the cursor position and scrolling position. By default, it also remembers these states across sessions by saving the data to disk.

This plugin doesn't do any polling and doesn't register any timers. It strives to only do work when opening and closing files in order to not slow down the editing experience.

## Developer Quickstart

My own workflow for working on this plugin is the following:

1.  Install the "*Remember File State*" plugin in a test vault. Don't forget to enable it.
2.  Clone the `obsidian-remember-file-state` repository.
3.  Run the usual incantations, such as `npm install`.
4.  Run the build process in watch mode so that it compiles the TypeScript code and overwrites the test vault's plugin: `npm run dogfood /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-remember-file-state`.
5.  When making changes, trigger the "*Reload App Without Saving*" command to reload Obsidian.
6.  Optionally, hit `Ctrl-Shift-I` to open the developer console and see the console log.
