Standalone
A standalone script is any script that is not [bound to a Google Sheets, Docs, Slides, or Forms file](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/bound?authuser=0). These scripts appear among your files in Google Drive.
## Creating a standalone script

The easiest way to create a standalone script is to visit [`script.google.com`](https://script.google.com/?authuser=0) and at the top left, click add**New project**.

You can also create standalone scripts from Google Drive. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/?authuser=0) and click **New > More > Google Apps Script**.

## Running a standalone script

To run a function from the script editor, at the top, select the name of the function you want to execute and click **Run**.

## Using a standalone script

Many standalone scripts are utility scripts — for example, to [search your Google Drive for old files whose name contains "untitled"](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/drive/drive-app?authuser=0#searchFiles(String)) so that you can delete them.

A standalone script can also be deployed as a [web app](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web?authuser=0) or set up to run automatically from an [installable trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable?authuser=0).

Finally, it is now possible for [add-ons](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/overview?authuser=0) to be [published](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/how-tos/publish-addons?authuser=0) from standalone scripts.
