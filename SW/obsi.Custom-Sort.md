## Freely arrange notes and folders in File Explorer ([https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin)

Take full control of the order of your notes and folders

The simplest usage scenario is to sort items via drag and drop:

For detailed instructions and videos go to [wiki documentation](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/wiki/How-to-order-items-in-File-Explorer-with-drag-and-drop%3F)

More advanced capabilities available through config-driven sorting:

-   treat folders and files equally or distinctively, you decide
-   fine-grained folder-level or even notes-group-level specification
-   support for fully manual order
    -   list notes and folders names explicitly, or use prefixes or suffixes only
    -   wildcard names matching supported
-   group and sort notes and folders by notes custom metadata
-   support for automatic sorting by standard and non-standard rules
-   mixing manual and automatic ordering also supported
-   order by compound numbers in prefix, in suffix (e.g. date in suffix) or inbetween
-   Roman numbers support, also compound Roman numbers
-   grouping by prefix or suffix or prefix and suffix
    -   different sorting rules per group even inside the same folder
-   simple to use yet versatile configuration options
-   order configuration stored directly in your note(s) front matter
    -   use a dedicated `sorting-spec:` key in YAML
-   folders not set up for the custom order remain on the standard Obsidian sorting
-   support for imposing inheritance of order specifications with flexible exclusion and overriding logic

---

## Basic scenario 1: set the custom sorting order for a specific folder

Create a new note named `sortspec` in the folder for which you want to configure the sorting

In the top of the new note put the following YAML front matter text:

\---
sorting-spec: |
  order-desc: a-z
\---

Click the ribbon button ([![Inactive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-inactive.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-inactive.png) or [![Static icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-mobile-initial.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-mobile-initial.png) on phone) to tell the plugin to read the sorting specification and apply it. The sorting should be applied to the folder. On desktops and tablets the ribbon icon should turn ([![Active](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-active.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-active.png))

!!! **Done!** !!!

You should see the files and sub-folders in your folder sorted in reverse alphabetical order, folders and files intermixed

An illustrative image which shows the reverse alphabetical order applied to the root folder of some vault:

### Remarks

> Remarks:
> 
> -   your new `sortspec` note should [look like this](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/blob/master/docs/examples/basic/sortspec.md?plain=1) except for the syntax highlighting, which could differ
> -   you will notice that the folders and files are treated equally and thus intermixed
>     -   the behavior depends on what files and subfolders you have in your folder
> -   changing the sorting order via the standard Obsidian UI button won't affect your folder, unless...
>     -   ...unless you deactivate the custom sorting via clicking the ribbon button to make it [![Inactive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-inactive.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-inactive.png)
> -   for clarity: the underlying file of the note `sortspec` is obviously `sortspec.md`
> -   in case of troubles refer to the [TL;DR section of advanced README.md](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/blob/master/docs/advanced-README.md#tldr-usage)
> -   feel free to experiment! The plugin works in a non-destructive fashion, and it doesn't modify the content of your vault. It only changes the order in which the files and folders are displayed in File Explorer
> -   indentation matters in YAML -> the two leading spaces in `order-desc: a-z` are intentional and required
> -   this common example only touches the surface of the rich capabilities of this custom sorting plugin. For more details go to [advanced version of README.md](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/blob/master/docs/advanced-README.md)

## Basic scenario 2: explicitly list folders and files in the order which you want

This comes from the suggestion by [TheOneLight](https://github.com/TheOneLight) in [this discussion](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/discussions/95#discussioncomment-7048584)

Take the instructions from the **[Basic scenario 1](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort#basic-scenario-set-the-custom-sorting-order-for-a-specific-folder)** above and replace the YAML content with:

\---
sorting-spec: |
  My first folder name
  My second folder name
  My first file name
  My second file name
  // ... and continue so in the desired order
\---

This will enforce the order as you listed inside the YAML

## Editing multi-line properties in the new YAML properties editor (Obsidian 1.4 and newer)

The newly introduced YAML properties editor (Obsidian 1.4 and newer) can make editing the multi-line text properties tricky and confusing. There are short videos here [How to create or edit a multi‚Äêline property in Obsidian?](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/wiki/How-to-create-or-edit-a-multi%E2%80%90line-property-in-Obsidian%3F) which could be helpful:

-   how to edit the multi-line text properties in Obsidian properties editor (`shift+enter` does the magic here)
-   how to edit the multi-line text properties in Obsidian `source view mode` (the classic way, as you did prior to Obsidian 1.4)

---

## Basic automatic sorting methods

The list of basic automatic sorting orders includes:

-   `order-asc: a-z` - **alphabetical order**, aka natural
    -   'a' goes before 'z' and numbers are treated specifically and 2 goes before 11
-   `order-desc: a-z` - **reverse alphabetical order**, aka reverse natural, aka descending alphabetical
    -   'z' goes before 'a' and numbers are treated specifically and 11 goes before 2
-   `order-asc: true a-z` - **true alphabetical order**
    -   'a' goes before 'z' and numbers are treated as texts and 11 goes before 2
-   `order-desc: true a-z` - **true reverse alphabetical order**, aka descending true alphabetical
    -   'z' goes before 'a' and numbers are treated as texts and 11 goes before 2
-   `order-asc: created` - **by creation date**
    -   the oldest notes go first. Sub-folders pushed to the top, alphabetically
-   `order-desc: created` - **by creation date, descending**
    -   the newest notes go first. Sub-folders pushed to the bottom, alphabetically
-   `order-asc: advanced created` - **by creation date, also for folders**
    -   the oldest notes and sub-folders go first
    -   for sub-folders the creation date of the oldest contained note is taken as folder's creation date
    -   sub-folders not containing any notes are pushed to the top, alphabetically
-   `order-desc: advanced created` - **by creation date, descending, also for folders**
    -   the newest notes and sub-folders go first
    -   for sub-folders the creation date of the newest contained note is taken as folder's creation date
    -   sub-folders not containing any notes are pushed to the bottom, alphabetically
-   `order-asc: modified` - **by modification date**
    -   the most dusty notes go first. Sub-folders pushed to the top, alphabetically
-   `order-desc: modified` - **by modification date, descending**
    -   the most recently modified notes go first. Sub-folders pushed to the bottom, alphabetically
-   `order-asc: advanced modified` - **by modification date, also for folders**
    -   the most dusty notes and sub-folders go first
    -   for sub-folders the modification date of the most dusty contained note is taken as folder's modification date
    -   sub-folders not containing any notes are pushed to the top, alphabetically
-   `order-desc: advanced modified` - **by modification date, descending, also for folders**
    -   the most recently modified notes and sub-folders go first
    -   for sub-folders the modification date of the most recently modified contained note is taken as folder's modification date
    -   sub-folders not containing any notes are pushed to the bottom, alphabetically

> Remark: In the above list the `-asc` stems from `Ascending` and `-desc` stems from `Descending`

## Manual sorting

The **manual ordering of notes and folders** is also done via the sorting configuration. Refer to the [TL;DR section of advanced README.md](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/blob/master/docs/advanced-README.md#tldr-usage) for examples and instructions

## Ribbon icon

Click the ribbon icon to toggle the plugin between enabled and suspended states.

States of the ribbon icon on large-screen devices (desktops, laptops and tablets like iPad):

On small-screen mobile devices (phones) the icon is static:

-   [![Static icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-mobile-initial.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-mobile-initial.png) The icon acts as a button to toggle between enabled and disabled. Its appearance doesn't change

For more details on the icon states refer to [Ribbon icon section of the advanced-README.md](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/blob/master/docs/advanced-README.md#ribbon-icon)

## Small screen mobile devices remarks

-   you might need to activate the custom sorting on your mobile separately, even if on a shared vault the custom sorting was activated on desktop
-   the Obsidian command palette being easily available (swipe down gesture on small-screen mobiles) allows for quick steering of the plugin via commands: sort-on and sort-off. This could be easier than navigating to and expanding the ribbon
-   the ribbon icon is static ([![Static icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-mobile-initial.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/icons/icon-mobile-initial.png)) and doesn't reflect the state of custom sorting. You can enable the *plugin state changes* notifications in settings, for the mobile devices only

## Installing the plugin

### From the official Obsidian Community Plugins page

The plugin could and should be installed from the official Obsidian Community Plugins list at [https://obsidian.md/plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins) or directly in the Obsidian app itself. Search the plugin by its name 'CUSTOM FILE EXPLORER SORTING'

> For other installation methods refer to [Installing the plugin section of advanced-README.md](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/blob/master/docs/advanced-README.md#installing-the-plugin)

## Credits

Thanks to [Nothingislost](https://github.com/nothingislost) for the monkey-patching ideas of File Explorer in [obsidian-bartender](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-bartender)

## ...and before you go, maybe you'd like the visual separators in File Explorer?

Do you want to have a nice-looking horizontal separators in File Explorer like this?

[![separators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/img/separators-by-replete.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/master/docs/img/separators-by-replete.png)

If so, head on to [Instruction and more context](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort/discussions/57#discussioncomment-4983763) by [@replete](https://github.com/replete)  
Quick & easy!

This feature is not dependent on the Custom Sorting plugin. At the same time I'm mentioning it here because it is a side effect of a discussion with [@replete](https://github.com/replete). We were considering a direct support of the Separators in the plugin. Eventually this boiled down to a very concise and smart CSS-snippet based solution, independent of the plugin. Go, see, copy to the CSS-snippets in Obsidian and enjoy the more grouped look
