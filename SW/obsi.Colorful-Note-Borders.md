## Colorful Note Borders Plugin for Obsidian

The Colorful Note Borders plugin for Obsidian is designed to help you visually distinguish your notes based on custom rules. By applying colored borders around your notes, you can easily recognize and categorize them based on their folder location or specific frontmatter metadata.

This plugin supports two types of rules:

1.  **Folder-based rules**: Apply a colorful border to notes based on their folder location. For example, you can configure a green border to be displayed around notes located in the "Inbox" folder.
2.  **Frontmatter metadata-based rules**: Apply a colorful border to notes based on their frontmatter metadata. For example, you can configure a red border to be displayed around notes that have "private: true" property in the frontmatter metadata.

By using the Colorful Note Borders plugin, you can create a more organized and visually appealing workspace in Obsidian. Customize your note appearance with an easy-to-configure settings page that allows you to define your color rules dynamically.
