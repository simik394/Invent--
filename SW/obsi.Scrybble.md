## Scrybble

Scrybble is a plugin which will synchronize your ReMarkable notes to your Obsidian vault.

For more information, check out the site: [scrybble.ink](https://scrybble.ink/)

---

Whenever Obsidian starts, this plugin will look for new ReMarkable notes synced via [the website](https://scrybble.ink/). You can also click on **sync manually** in the scrybble settings page to initiate syncing yourself.

By default, your notes get synced to the `scrybble` folder.
