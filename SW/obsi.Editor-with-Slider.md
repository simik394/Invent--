## Obsidian Line Width Slider Plugin

> A plugin for Obsidian that allows you to adjust the editor line width using a simple slider in the status bar.

## Features

-   Adjust the line width of the editor using a slider in the status bar.
-   Increase or decrease the line width to customize your editing experience.
-   Simple and intuitive interface for easy usage.

### Feature: Custom for Individual Files using YAML

With the Obsidian Line Width Slider Plugin, you can now customize the editor width for individual files by specifying an "editor-width" field in the YAML frontmatter of your notes. This feature allows you to have different line widths for different files, giving you greater flexibility in your note-taking and editing experience.

#### Setting the Editor Width

To set a custom editor width for a specific file, follow these steps:

1.  Open the note for which you want to customize the editor width.
    
2.  In the YAML frontmatter section at the top of the note, add an "editor-width" field. The value of this field should be a number between 0 and 100, representing the desired editor width as a percentage of the viewport width. For example:
    
    \---
    title: My Customized Note
    editor-width: 75
    ---
