## Obsidian folder notes

Folder notes is a plugin for the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that lets you attach notes to folders so that you can click on the name of a folder to open the note like in the app [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). This plugin has some unique features that separate it from similar "Folder note" plugins like opening folder notes through the path, creating folder notes for every existing folder, templater/template support and more.

## Documentation & download link

The plugin can be downloaded by clicking on [https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=folder-notes](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=folder-notes) and then on install. If you need help with the plugin or want to know what the features are that the plugin has then you can find the documentation at [https://lostpaul.github.io/obsidian-folder-notes/](https://lostpaul.github.io/obsidian-folder-notes/).
