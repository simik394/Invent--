## Markdown Tree plugin

[](https://github.com/carvah/markdown-tree-plugin#markdown-tree-plugin)

To create directory trees with a more visually appealing format using the Markdown Tree plugin, follow these steps:

1.  Start with the root directory.
2.  Use indentation with spaces or tabs to represent nested directories.
3.  Place files directly under their respective directories.

## Example

[](https://github.com/carvah/markdown-tree-plugin#example)

Consider the following directory structure:

`root     second         third             fourth                 file1.jpg                 file2.txt                 file3.pdf`

To transform this structure into a prettier directory tree using the **Markdown Tree** plugin, use the following input:

` ```markdown-tree root     second         third             fourth                 file1.jpg                 file2.txt                 file3.pdf `

When rendered the output will be:

`. └── root     └── second         └── third             └── fourth                 ├── file1.jpg                 ├── file2.txt                 └── file3.pdf`
