## 😎 Quick start
BN offers a range of features that can be combined like Lego blocks to build your own note-taking workflow.

Start taking notes in Zotero with BN in **5 minutes**!

### Getting Started with the _Workspace_

The _workspace_ serves as the **central hub** where input flows (papers and annotations) converge with output flows (summaries and comparisons).

To open the _workspace_, click the [![icon](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes/raw/master/addon/chrome/content/icons/favicon.png)](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes/blob/master/addon/chrome/content/icons/favicon.png) button in the tabs bar.

[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33902321/236622132-5ed9bd23-3c0e-4775-b273-745824cc4b51.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33902321/236622132-5ed9bd23-3c0e-4775-b273-745824cc4b51.gif)

The _workspace_ contains a default note called the _workspace note_. You can create a new note as the _workspace note_ if prompted on opening _workspace_.

> 💡 How to set an existing note as the _workspace note_?
> 
> 1. In the library: select a note item and right-click
> 2. In the note editor: click on the Tools button
> 
> You can change the _workspace note_ at any time.

The _workspace_ allows you to take notes and write, just like you would in MS Word or a markdown editor (e.g., Obsidian).

> **Explore the _Workspace_!**  
> 💡 The layout from left to right is:
> 
> - Outline
> - _Workspace note_ editor (main editor)
> - Note link preview (hidden by default)
> - Reader notes pane (hidden by default)
> 
> 💡 To toggle these panes, hover the _workspace_ tab and click corresponding buttons.  
> 💡 To open the _workspace_ in a new window, drag the _workspace_ tab.

### Note Editor

The _workspace_ includes the note editor for the _workspace note_. You can use it to take notes and write summaries.

> 💡 How to open note editor?
> 
> - In the library: click to open a note editor and double-click to open note editor in a standalone window.
> - In the PDF reader: right-side bar
> 
> 💡 How to create a new note?  
> Click the note icon in the library tools bar (the row under the tabs bar).

### Syncing: Note 🔄️ Markdown

With BN, you can integrate your note-taking into your existing workflow seamlessly. If you use markdown editors like Obsidian, you can keep your notes in sync with external Markdown files easily.

To set up auto-sync, click `Set Auto-Sync` the first time you export your note. There is no need for any third-party tools or complicated setups!

[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33902321/236622955-9ca54590-d6f8-433a-8622-33b35fc7b79d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33902321/236622955-9ca54590-d6f8-433a-8622-33b35fc7b79d.png)

Any changes made to your note or its corresponding Markdown file will be automatically synced. This feature makes it easy to keep all of your notes up to date and in one place.

> 💡 Note: The note being edited will be synced after the editor is closed.

### Note Export

BN offers various options to export your notes, giving you the flexibility to choose the format that suits your needs.

You can export your note to the following formats:

- A new note in Zotero
- Markdown file (embedded or linked, with images)

Simply click on the corresponding export button in the toolbar and follow the prompts.
