## Improved Random Note Obsidian Plugin

[](https://github.com/ShockThunder/improved-random-note#improved-random-note-obsidian-plugin)

Improved interaction with the knowledge base in so-called wandering mode by opening Random Notes

Unlike its analogs combines the following options:

-   Opening a random note without having to create an intermediate search term
-   Opening a random note in a new panel
-   Excluding notes from specific folders from the output. Useful for excluding Archives, Templates and other service folders.
-   Can open notes only with a certain tag and in combination with exclusion of certain folders from output.

The plugin is developed specifically for the Second Brain project ([https://second-brain.ru/](https://second-brain.ru/)).
