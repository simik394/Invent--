### Keyboard Block Navigation

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Enable Block Selector

block-selector.mov

Inspired by Notion's block navigation, this feature allows you to select blocks in the reading view by clicking on them. Selected blocks will be highlighted, and you can navigate between blocks using the arrow keys.

💡 Additionally, there is a `Select top block in the view` command, which allows you to assign a hotkey for keyboard control.

If a selected block is too long, the plugin will automatically scroll to display the block's top or bottom, loading adjacent blocks that are not yet in the DOM tree.

-   `ArrowDown`: Select the next block
-   `ArrowUp`: Select the previous block
-   `ArrowLeft`/`ArrowRight`: Toggle fold/unfold

❗️ To disable this feature only on mobile, enable the 'Disable Block Selector on Mobile' option in settings.

#### What is a "Block"?

In this plugin, a "block" refers to an HTML element that can be considered a distinct content unit within a markdown document. Paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, code blocks, quotes, media elements, and callouts are examples of blocks.

#### Block Color

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Block Color

You can set a custom color for the block highlight effect.

  

### Always-visible Collapse Indicators

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Always on collapse indicator

By default, collapse indicators are invisible until hovered over.

### Table Overflow Prevention

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Prevent Table Overflowing

table-overflow.mov

Enable horizontally scrollable tables to prevent table overflow.

In Obsidian v1.1.16, tables having a word longer than the viewport's width will create a horizontal scrollbar across the entire view, which can be inconvenient on mobile devices.

  

### Scrollable Code Blocks

> ⚡️ Settings > Reading View Enhancer > Scrollable Code

This feature makes code blocks scrollable, rather than using line-wrapping.

By default, codes get line-wrapped when it's too long.

You can make code blocks scrollable instead of line break.
